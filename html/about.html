                <p>Hello, I'm Chelsea James. I was born in Georgetown, Guyana and immigrated to Queens, New York at the age of two. Growing up in New York City was more than I could've ever asked for. I was able to express myself in any way that I wanted. I became interested in musical theater at a young age and would often run from audition to audition with my mother. </p>

                <p>As I grew older I decided to venture off into visual art. I took a chance and auditioned for Laguardia Arts with my minimal art background and I was accepted. My love for art grew tremendously because of the environment that I was exposed to. </p>
                <p>
                    My favorite things to do are find new restuarants to go to, find new coffee shops/bakeries to go to, binge watch Netflix, and learn new languages. Since I am from a huge city, I also enjoy strolling around the city to find these new places. Once I find a great new place I bring all my friends and we would hang out there.
                </p>
                <p> I would describe myself as a super chill person that's easy to get along with. I've once been told that I have a very calming personality, I'm not exactly sure what that means though, but I'll take it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, and I'm not really a dog or cat person. I'm more of a colorful fish person
