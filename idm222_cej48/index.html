            <h3>Hi, I'm Chelsea James </h3>
            <p>I am an undergraduate student majoring in Interactive Digital Media at Drexel University. I am orginally from New York City and decided to come to Philadelphia for college. I have a wide knowledge of fine arts and enjoy making pottery in my free time. My goal is to become a brilliant web designer and eventually start my own tech company after I graduate. I would also like to travel around the world to understand how people of different cultures expect their UX and UI to look like. </p>
